"""
File: helloworld.py
-------------------
This is my first python program.  It is customary to
have a programmer's first program write "hello world!"
(inspired by the first program in Brian Kernighan and
Dennis Ritchie's classic book, 'The C Programming Language.')
"""


def main():
    print("hello world!")

# This allows the program to print the text "hello, world!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# This tells the program to run it in python to run the main() function.
