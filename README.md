CS106A - Programming Methodology is a online course provided by Stanford University, focusing on the introduction to the engineering of computer applications, emphasizing modern software engineering principles such as: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing. I had taken an updated version which was taught in Python as part of their initiative called Code in Place.

These projects were built using PyCharm, a professional Python IDE. Below are some documents which provide information on how to set up PyCharm and how to use Karel in PyCharm:
