# CS106A
CS106A - Programming Methodology is a online course provided by Stanford University, focusing on the introduction to the engineering of computer applications, emphasizing modern software engineering principles such as: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing. I had taken an updated version which was taught using Python as part of their initiative, named Code in Place.

These projects were built using PyCharm, a professional Python IDE and were personally annotated. Do note that certain programs require you to import libraries by installing them using the terminal (indicated at the start of each program file). The entire repository can be downloaded as a ZIP file by clicking on the green "<> Code" button. Below are documents that provide information on how to set up PyCharm and how to use Karel in PyCharm:
